# # This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# # The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# # Examples:
# #
# #   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
# #   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#     Book.create!(title: Faker::Title.name, title:       Faker::Superhero.power, stock: Faker::Number.between(2, 19))
#    book_ids = Book.ids
#    95.times do
#     Flow.create!(book_id: book_ids.sample, newStock:      Faker::Number.between(2, 15), previousStock:    Faker::Number.between(2, 15))
#    endrails g model Book isbn:integer title stock:integer
